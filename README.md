## [AAAI 2026] [LQ]  From Inception to Productization: Hands-on Lab for the Lifecycle of Multimodal Agentic AI in Industry 4.0

### Introduction
Welcome to our interactive lab session at AAAI 2026! 🎉 This lab is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in tackling the challenges of rare event prediction in manufacturing. Through a structured approach covering data generation, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation, attendees will gain practical insights into multimodal AI modeling and its explainability.

### Lab Schedule

#### **Part 1 - Introduction and Overview**
- Overview of rare event prediction and anomaly prediction in smart manufacturing.
- Discussion of objectives and expected takeaways from the lab.

#### **Part 2 - Exploring Datasets for Rare Event Analysis**
- Overview of publicly available datasets for rare event prediction.
- Deep dive into manufacturing-specific datasets (Pulp-and-paper manufacturing and Future Factories (FF) datasets) and its role in rare event prediction.

#### **Part 3 - Addressing Data Scarcity and Improving Data Quality**
- Hands-on session on using data augmentation techniques and modeling approaches to improve rare event prediction.

#### **Part 4 - Model Selection, Development, and Evaluation**
- Hands-on session with anomaly prediction using robust modeling techniques, including dependency capture between rare events.

#### **Part 5 - Development and Use of Process Ontology**
- Introduction to process ontology for rare event prediction.
- Hands-on session on using process ontology for generating user-level explanations.

#### **Summary and Q/A**
- Recap of the session and open discussion with participants.
